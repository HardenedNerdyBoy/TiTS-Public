/*Submissive haze
Author: HNB

Duration: 6 days

Notes:
Created by Dr. Badger to protect her experiment Dungeon. Comes with a variety of symptoms with the plan of making intruders more suggestible to just simply staying in the dungeon and helping with the experimentation.
It's possible that a few creatures have contracted it but they probably never left the dungeon to tell anyone. 
It's designed to form submissive tendencies, fatigue and increased lust in those that contract it and to heavily effect them for a short period of time, long enough for them to love the dungeons creatures on their own.

Symptoms:
[Contraction] - Feel slightly light headed (No gameplay effects)
[4 hours] - Codex tells you there's something wrong with you, unidentifiable (no gameplay effects)
[8 hours] - Minor increase to lust damage due to tingly feeling skin and sexual thoughts (+10% to all lust damage taken AND take 5 lust damage)
[16 hours] - -3 intelligence due to brainfog.
[1 days] - Raise base lust due to sexual thoughts and gain lust whilst clothed due to skin sensitivity (+2 lust on move AND +10 min lust).
[1.5 days] - Feel a little tired (No gameplay effect)
[1.75 days] - Submissive thoughts (-3 willpower, take 5 lust damage)
[2 days] - -30 max energy for duration of illness done in energyMax - body feels heavy and you just want to lay down
[2.5 days] - Subby, want to lay down and sex (Is subby whilst illness lasts)
[3 days] - Dick shrinkage (Random 1-10%) OR bigger lips (+1 rating)
[4 days] - Thinking feels slightly lighter (+2 int)
[5 days] - Submissive tendencies and tiredness gone (Max energy reverted and subby reverted)
[6 days] - Lusty thoughts return to normal ending the effect (Lust damage % increase reverted, moving lust reverted)

Overall, player should end up with 1 lower int, 3 lower willpower and a smaller dick OR bigger lips. 
For the duration, the player will take a lot of lust damage, increasing risk and will be susceptible to any submission checks (There's a couple in RaskExp dialogue).
